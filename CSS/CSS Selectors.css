/* CSS selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML elements. */
/* Selectors "find" HTML elements based on their id, class, type, attribute, etc. */

/* An element selector selects elements based on the element name */
p {
	color: red;
	text-align: left;
}

/* An id selector selects elements based on their id attribute */
/* id's should be unique within a page (ie: used for a single, unique element in an HTML document) */
#p01 {
	color: blue;
	text-align: right;
}

/* A class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute */
/* In the following example, all HTML elements with the class "center" will be center aligned */
.center {
	text-align: center;
}

/* A class selector can also be used to refer to only specific HTML elements */
p.center {
	text-align: center;
}

/* Elements with the same style definitions can be grouped together */
h1, h2, p {
	text-align: center;
	color: red;
}
