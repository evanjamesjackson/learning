/* It is possible to style HTML elements based on their attributes and attribute values */
/* The [attribute], [attribute=value] selectors in CSS can do this */

/* The following selects all <a> elements that have a target attribute */
a[target] {
	background-color: yellow;
}

/* The following selects all <a> elements with a target attribute with a value of "_blank" */
a[target="_blank"] {
	background-color: red;
}

/* The following selectors are also available in CSS: 
	[attribute~=value] - selects elements with an attribute value containing a specific word (whole words only)
	[attribute|=value] - selects elements with the specified attribute with values starting with the specified value (eg: [class|="top"] will select elements with class "top" and "top-text") (whole words only)
	[attribute^=value] - selects elements with the specified attribute with values starting with the specified value (whole words not required)
	[attribute$=value] - selects elements with the specified attribute with values ending with the specified value (whole words not required)
