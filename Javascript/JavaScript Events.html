<!-- JavaScript can react to HTML events -->
<!-- Common HTML events:
		-onchange - an HTML element has been changed
		-onclick - the user clicks an HTML element
		-onmouseover - the user moves the mouse over an HTML element
		-onmouseout - the user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
		-onkeydown - the user pushes a keyboard key
		-onload - the browser has finished loading the page
-->

<!-- The addEventListener() method can be used to attach an event handler to a specified element:
	element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture)
	where:
		-event is the type of event
		-function is the function to be called when the event occurs
		-useCapture is a boolean value specifying whether to use event bubbling or event capturing (optional)
-->

<button id="button1">Click me</button>
<script>
	document.getElementById("button1").addEventListener("click", function(){alert("T'anks")});
	/* Note that multiple event listeners can be added to the same element */
	document.getElementById("button1").addEventListener("click", changeBackground);

	function changeBackground () {
		document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0].style.background = "green";
	}
</script>

<!-- Event handlers can also be added to the window itself -->
<script>
	window.addEventListener("resize", function () {document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0].style.background = "blue"});
</script>
<p>Try resizing the screen</p>

<!-- There are two methods of event propagation:
		1. bubbling - The innermost element's event is handled first, then the outer (set useCapture to false)
		2. capturing - The outermost element's event is handled first, then the inner (set useCapture to true)
