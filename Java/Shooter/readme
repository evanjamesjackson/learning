Unfinished Java project started in Summer 2012.

Working now:
  -player ship can be moved using up/down arrow keys
  -player ship can shoot bullet by clicking left mouse button
  -enemy ship follows player ship's vertical position and moves to match it
  -enemy ship attempts to move away from incoming bullet
