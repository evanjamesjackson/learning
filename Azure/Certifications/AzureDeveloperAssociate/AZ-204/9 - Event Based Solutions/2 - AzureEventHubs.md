- Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service
- Azure Event Hubs represent an "event instigator" frontdoor that sits between event publishers and event consumers, thus decoupling the two
- Key concepts in Event Hubs:
    - An **Event Hub client** is the primary interface for developers interacting with the Event Hubs library
    - An **Event Hub producer** is a type of client that serves as a source of data
    - An **Event Hub consumer** is a type of client which reads information from the Event Hub
    - A **partition** is an ordered sequence of events that enables parallelism for event consumers (i.e. each consumer reads a specific partition or subset of the message stream)
    - A **consumer group** is a logical grouping of event consumers
    - **Event receivers** are any entity that reads event data from the Hub
- Event Hubs Capture automatically streams data to an Azure Blob storage or Azure Data Lake Storage account
- `EventProcessorClient` is a .NET class that allows you to read data from an Event Hub
- when designing a consumer application in a distributed environment, the following should be taken into consideration:
    - scaling - multiple consumers should be running, each reading from Event Hub partitions
    - load balancing - configure consumers to rebalance the number of partitions they own when load increases
    - seamless resume on failures - configure consumers to pick up partitions of others if those consumers encounter an error
    - checkpointing - mark the point in the partition of the last successful read, so that other consumers can continue from there if the consumer reading that partition fails
    - thread safety and synchronization
- Access to Event Hubs can be controlled using SAS, managed identities, and Active Directory
