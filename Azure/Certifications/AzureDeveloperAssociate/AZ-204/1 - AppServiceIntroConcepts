-scaling up/down affects the RAM/cores used by your app
-scaling in/out affects the number of machine instances running your app
-deployment slots are only available in Standard/Premium pricing tiers
-Azure will soon support ability to share Windows/Linux apps in the same resource group
-an ASP defines the region, number of VM instances, size of those VM instances, and a pricing tiers
-"shared" are literally shared with other customers
-consumption tier only supports function apps currently; autoscales based on usage
-if an ASP is configured to run five VM instances, then all apps in the plan run on all five instances
-put apps in a separate plan when the app is 1) resource intensive, 2) you want to scale it independently, 3) the app needs resources in
a separate region
-whenever possible, use deployment slots! Swapping warms up the necessary worker instances, eliminating downtime
-"hybrid connections" allow you to control outbound IP addresses of an app service
