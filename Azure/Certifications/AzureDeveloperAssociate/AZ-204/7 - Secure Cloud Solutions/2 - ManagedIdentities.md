- **Managed identities** provide identities for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory authentication
- There are two types of managed identities:
    1. **System-assigned** - enabled directly on an Azure service instance and tied to its lifecycle
    2. **User-assigned managed identity** - created as a standalone Azure resource, and can be assigned to one or more Azure service instances. Its lifecycle is independent and must be explicitly deleted
