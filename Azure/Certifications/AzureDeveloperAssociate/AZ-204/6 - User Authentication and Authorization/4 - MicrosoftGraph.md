- Microsoft Graph provides an API for Microsoft 365
- Graph "Connectors" deliver data data external to Azure into Microsoft Graph services
- The Microsoft Graph REST API can be used to access Microsoft 365 resources
- some best practices when using Graph:
    - use an OAuth 2.0 flow to acquire an access token before requesting resources from Graph
    - use least privelege
    - use the correct permission type based on the scenario (i.e. delegated or application permissions)
    - handle responses effectively (e.g. pagination, evolving enumerations)
    - don't store data locally unless really necessary
