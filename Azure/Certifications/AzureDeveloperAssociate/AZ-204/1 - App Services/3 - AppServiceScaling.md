- autoscalilng adjusts available resources based on current demand
	- autoscaling performs scaling in/out, rather than up/down
	- autoscaling adds/removes web serveces and balances the load between them; no effect on CPU power, memory, or storage capacity
- autoscaling makes decisions based on rules you defines
- autoscaling should be used for apps that have sporadic workloads
	- don't use them for handling long-term growth
- autoscaling success/failure are logged in Activity Log and can be configured to send alerts via SMS, email, webhooks, etc
- autoscaling best practices:
	- ensure the max/min instance values have an adequate margin between them
	- choose the appropriate statistic (avg, min, max) for the metric by which your app will scale
	- ensure a good margin between metric thresholds. Azure has built in "anti flapping" measures that ensure an app is not scaled in/out
	in an infinite loop, usually because two thresholds are too close
- when multiple rules are configured - scale-out will occur if any (not necessarily all) rules are met; scale-in requies all rules to be met
