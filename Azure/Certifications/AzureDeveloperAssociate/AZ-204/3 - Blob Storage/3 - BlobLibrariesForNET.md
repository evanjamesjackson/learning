- Several .NET classes available for working with Azure Storage:
    - BlobClient allows you to manipulate blobs
    - BlobClientOptions provides configuration options when connecting to Storage
    - BlobContainerClient allows you to manipulate containers and their blobs
    - BlobServiceClient allows you to manipulate Storage service resources
    - BlobUriBuilder can modify the contents of a Uri instance to point to different Storage resources (accounts, containers, blobs)
- Blob containers support system properties and user-defined metadata (key-value pairs)
    - Custom metadata is represented as HTTP headers when creating a resource, or creates a property on an existing resource
    - Some standard HTTP properties on containers/blobs include 'Last-Modified', 'Content-Length', 'Cache-Control', etc.
